# Identifying Fraud from Enron Email
The goal of this project was to use financial and email data for classifying Enron employees into two groups based on whether they were involved in [corporate fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) or not. This project was made for Udacity [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). See [project documentation](Documentation.pdf) for more info.
